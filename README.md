# Clown Raid: The Itinerant Circus!
Spawns Parades in your world, they're pretty much like how Wandering Traders appear, and can have the following mobs:

### Presenter
The leader of the Circus, sells tickets, tokens and passcards and wants to build their Circus tent after you buy some and go to sleep, but they don't know how to do it yet.

### Marcher
Does not sell anything, but they have some Goat Horns and other instruments if they exist, I wonder if there are means to obtain it...

### Seller
Sells food, flowers, cure-all medicine, balloons, idk what else you'd expect from a mob called that

### Clown
Sells some tricks and a very funny item, they like confetti (like all them do) and people who use subtitles
